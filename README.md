# League of Legends bot

Documentation of my [League of Legends](http://telegram.me/LoL_bot) Bot for Telegram.


# Getting Started

First of all, this bot is running under Docker with the help of Docker Compose, so you need to install it.

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Then you need to create your configuration file. You can file a sample configuration file at `extra_data/extra.json.sample` so you can just remove the `.sample` part and edit it with your configuration.

For setting up your configuration, you should edit the next parameters from that file:

- **admins**: Change `admin_id` with your Telegram ID
- **token**: Your bot token. Get it from [Bot Father](https://telegram.me/botfather)
- **token_logbot**: Your logging bot token. This is optional, only if you are going to use the `/log` command
- **lol_api**: Your LoL API key from RIOT. Request it at the [developer's portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
- **tft_api**: Your TFT API key from RIOT. Request it at the [developer's portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/)

You can use the developing token for both **lol_api** and **tft_api** for your tests, but the ideal is to request an API key for accessing the LoL API and the TFT API.

Next thing you should be changing is the file `extra_data/file_ids.json` replacing the content with only this:

```json
{}
```

That's pretty much all the pre-steps you should do before setting up the bot. If you have already done all the above steps, you can now run the bot by typing this in the folder where the bot is:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

If you followed all the steps, your bot should have received a message from your bot telling you it has started.

Now you should use the command `/update_champs x.x.1` changing `x.x` with the lattest version of the game, so if the lattest version is the `11.12` you should send to the bot `/update_champs 11.12.1`. Then the bot will start sending you some messages and it will send you all the game splasharts to fill the file `extra_data/file_ids.json` automatically.

Now it is your time to play with the bot, learn how it works internally and make a pull request with some interesting new features :) PS: You can use the file called `plantilla.py` as a template for new commands ðŸ˜‰

For troubleshooting, check the bot logs by typing:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```
